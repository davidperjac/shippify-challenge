## The Challenge

For this challenge you have to create a small project from scratch to showcase your coding skills, project architecture knowledge and attention to detail. ✨
Given a MySQL database with the tables company, driver and vehicle, create 4 endpoints for the following purposes:
1.	List vehicles by driver
2.	Create a new vehicle
3.	Update an existing vehicle
4.	Delete a vehicle

Using React, create a project with services to interact with the endpoints previously created above. The final deliverable should see a table listing the vehicles by a given driver, and allow the user to create, edit or delete a vehicle.
While we require that you use NodeJS v12 + Express, the software architectural pattern and project structure is up to you. This is your opportunity to shine and show us your full potential as a full-stack developer.
Create a GitHub repository for this project so you can share it with us. It must be finished and running by the time we have the technical call on DATE, so you could explain to us your decisions taken to solve this challenge, and additional features you may want to include.
We are eager to know your abilities! Good luck. ✌️
